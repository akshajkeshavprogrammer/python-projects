🐍 Akshaj’s Python Projects

This repo is where I drop all the Python projects I’ve been building.
Some are from my earlier coding days, and from today (20/08/2025) onwards everything new goes here too — so you’ll see my progress from beginner experiments to real projects.

## How to Run a Project
`bash
git clone https://github.com/akshajkeshavprogrammer/python-projects.git  
cd python-projects  
python calculator.py   # or any other .py file

🙋 About Me

I’m Akshaj Keshav, 13 y/o, and I’ve been learning, experimenting, and building with Python.
This repo is basically my growth story — from simple projects to more advanced stuff. I like keeping things real: some of the older code is messy, but that’s proof of how far I’ve come (and how far I’m going).

 Future Plans=>

I’m aiming to:

Build bigger, more creative projects (apps, games, tools)

Step into web development and AI as I grow

Write cleaner code that looks pro — so one day, I’ll laugh at how noob my old code was 😅

Not just learning for the sake of it — I’m building skills to create things people actually use.

⚡ Reminder: This repo is alive. Check back later and you’ll see the glow-up continue.
